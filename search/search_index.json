This allows you to develop tools while dividing the work between modelers, viewers, etc. QSS has also been extended to allow the use of custom properties that are not available in regular PySide2. I have also prepared a buildable bat that makes it easy to use custom Font and images. Since this is a sample, I have not implemented anything that will actually work, but you can easily implement these features as well. Setting up Candybox to work. Install a Python3 Let\u2019s first install Python3. The sample used Python 3.7.7 Create a virtualenv Open Folder with VSCode and then Let's run makevenv.bat. After a while, you will see ../candybox/.venv should be created. Install python modules Let's run pipInstall.bat. Various modules should be installed. Run and Debug Please start Run And Debug Candybox.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"A design sample that also supports the model/view architecture for multi-person tool development using PySide2.
